## 🌟 Introduction
This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. Accurate stock price prediction can provide significant advantages in financial trading, and this project explores various models to achieve this goal.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 Data collection and preprocessing
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🤖 Machine Learning models for prediction
- 📈 Model evaluation and comparison
- 📉 Visualization of results

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Forecasting-Financial-Futures.git
    ```
2. Change to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Forecasting-Financial-Futures
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```sh
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```sh
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
5. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage
1. To preprocess the data, run:
    ```sh
    python preprocess.py
    ```
2. To train the model, run:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```
3. To evaluate the model, run:
    ```sh
    python evaluate.py
    ```

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is obtained from [source of dataset]. It includes historical stock prices with the following features:
- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume

## 🤖 Model
The following machine learning models were explored in this project:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

## 📉 Results
The performance of each model was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results are summarized below:
- Linear Regression: MAE = X, RMSE = Y
- Decision Tree Regressor: MAE = X, RMSE = Y
- Random Forest Regressor: MAE = X, RMSE = Y
- Support Vector Regressor: MAE = X, RMSE = Y
- LSTM: MAE = X, RMSE = Y

## 🚀 Future Work
- Implement additional models such as ARIMA and Prophet
- Enhance feature engineering
- Use more advanced deep learning techniques
- Integrate real-time data for live predictions
